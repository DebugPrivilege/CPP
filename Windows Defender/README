[Restoring Windows Defender from tampering]

During IR engagements, we have seen plenty of times that threat actors are tampering Windows Defender AV. This makes it easier to roll out ransomware or executing malicious tools for example. 
There are real cases, such as the HIVE or LockBit ransomware cases. Where we have seen evidence of this ransomware tampering Windows Defender.
I’ve decided to code something up, which is meant to restore Windows Defender AV in a healthy state, after it has been tampered. 
This tool has been tested on Windows Server 2016, 2019 and 2022. Not just on the server side, but also on Windows 10 clients. 
We often only need to use the –start parameter, which is used to restore Windows Defender AV configurations. However, I’ve decided to add some additional features.
In this document, we will be going through all the features and explain how to deploy the binary and how to use it, etc.
